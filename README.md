# "500 Lines or Less" OCR code rewritten in Python@3.11

Shamelessly copied from [500lines](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines.git). I kept the original under `python2.7`. If you simply watch the python3 version just clone the python3 branch.

**Todo**:

* Training the python3.11 version seems to make the ANN think every number is 9 for some reason, even though `neural_network_design.py` shows valid results as shown below.
